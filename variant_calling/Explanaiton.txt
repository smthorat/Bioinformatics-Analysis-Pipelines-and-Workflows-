Nextflow Workflow Explanation: E. coli Variant Calling Pipeline

This Nextflow workflow is a structured and automated pipeline for detecting genetic variants in E. coli sequencing data. It ensures reproducibility, scalability, and efficiency by leveraging parallel execution and optimized data processing techniques. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of each stage of the pipeline.

1️⃣ Reference Genome Indexing

Before starting variant calling, we need to prepare the reference genome. This step generates index files that allow efficient and fast access to specific regions of the genome when mapping reads.
	•	FASTA Indexing: This process creates a small index file that allows tools like Samtools, BWA, and GATK to rapidly retrieve sections of the reference genome instead of scanning the entire file.
	•	Sequence Dictionary: GATK requires a sequence dictionary file that provides metadata about the reference genome, such as chromosome names and lengths.

Without these index files, subsequent steps like read alignment and variant calling would be slow and inefficient.

2️⃣ Quality Control of Raw Reads

Once the sequencing reads (FASTQ files) are available, we assess their quality before proceeding to alignment. Poor-quality reads can introduce false positives in variant detection, so this step ensures we are working with high-quality data.
	•	Quality Score Distribution: This checks the accuracy of base calls made by the sequencer.
	•	GC Content Analysis: Analyzing the GC content ensures that there is no significant bias in the sequencing.
	•	Overrepresented Sequences: Some sequences may appear more frequently than expected, possibly due to contamination or sequencing artifacts.

By performing quality control, we can determine if trimming or pre-processing is necessary before alignment.

3️⃣ Read Alignment to Reference Genome

After quality control, we map the sequencing reads to the reference genome using BWA-MEM, a widely used alignment algorithm optimized for next-generation sequencing data.
	•	Mapping Reads: The algorithm aligns each short read to the most similar region in the reference genome.
	•	Read Groups: We add metadata (such as sample ID and platform) to the reads, which helps in downstream analyses like duplicate marking and variant calling.
	•	Handling Unmapped Reads: Some reads may not align to the reference due to sequencing errors or contamination. These are usually discarded or analyzed separately.

The output of this step is a SAM file (Sequence Alignment Map), which is a human-readable format containing alignment information.

4️⃣ Sorting, Deduplication, and BAM Processing

To improve computational efficiency and accuracy, we process the aligned reads before variant calling.
	•	Converting SAM to BAM: Since SAM files are large and inefficient, we convert them into BAM files, which store the same information in a compressed, indexed format.
	•	Sorting Alignments: Alignments are sorted based on their position in the genome to allow for faster processing.
	•	Removing PCR Duplicates: During library preparation, the same DNA fragment may be sequenced multiple times, leading to duplicate reads. These duplicates do not represent true biological variation and must be removed to prevent bias.

At the end of this step, we have a clean, indexed BAM file ready for variant calling.

5️⃣ Variant Calling

Once we have high-quality, aligned reads, we proceed to identify genetic variants.
	•	HaplotypeCaller (GVCF Mode): This method detects single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions/deletions (INDELs) and outputs them in Genomic VCF (GVCF) format, which stores information on all positions, including non-variant sites.
	•	Genotyping Variants: The GVCF file is then processed using GenotypeGVCFs, which produces the final VCF file containing all detected variants.

At this stage, we have an unfiltered variant file that includes both high-confidence and low-confidence calls.

6️⃣ Filtering Variants for Quality

Not all detected variants are biologically relevant. Some may be due to sequencing errors, mapping artifacts, or low-quality regions. To refine the dataset, we apply variant filtration criteria.

Filters Applied:
	1.	Quality by Depth (QD): Low values indicate uncertain variant calls.
	2.	Fisher Strand Bias (FS): Measures strand bias, which can indicate sequencing errors.
	3.	Mapping Quality (MQ): Ensures only variants in well-mapped regions are retained.
	4.	Strand Odds Ratio (SOR): Detects imbalanced strand representation.
	5.	Genotype Quality (GQ) and Read Depth (DP): Ensures that only variants with enough supporting reads are retained.

After filtering, we obtain high-confidence SNPs and INDELs, removing false positives.

7️⃣ Variant Annotation

Now that we have filtered, high-quality variants, we need to understand their biological significance.

What Happens During Annotation?
	•	Each SNP and INDEL is compared against known databases.
	•	Functional impact on genes, proteins, and regulatory regions is assessed.
	•	Information such as amino acid changes, gene names, and mutation effects is added.

Since Funcotator (GATK’s annotation tool) is designed for human genomes, this step should be adapted for bacterial annotations. Tools like SnpEff or Prokka may be better suited for E. coli annotation.

Final Outputs and Interpretation

At the end of the pipeline, we obtain the following key files:
	1.	Final Variant Call File (final_variants.vcf.gz)
	•	Contains all detected genetic variants in E. coli.
	2.	Filtered High-Quality SNPs (analysis-ready-snps.vcf)
	•	A refined list of single nucleotide polymorphisms with high confidence.
	3.	Filtered High-Quality INDELs (analysis-ready-indels.vcf)
	•	High-confidence insertions and deletions.
	4.	Annotated Variants (analysis-ready-snps-filteredGT-functotated.vcf)
	•	Includes gene names, functional impact, and metadata for each variant.

These results can be used for comparative genomics, antibiotic resistance studies, and evolutionary analysis in E. coli.

This workflow is automated using Nextflow, making it highly scalable and reproducible, whether running on a local machine or HPC cluster.

Why Use Nextflow for This Pipeline?
	•	Scalability → Can handle multiple samples in parallel.
	•	Reproducibility → Ensures the same results regardless of where it’s run.
	•	Portability → Works on HPC, cloud, or local systems.
	•	Checkpointing → Resumes where it left off if interrupted.

This pipeline can easily be extended to include structural variant calling, phylogenetic analysis, or AMR detection, depending on the research goal.
